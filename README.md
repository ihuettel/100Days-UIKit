# 100 Days of Swift (UIKit)

This is where I will be hosting all my projects from 100 Days of Swift.

I still plan to add more to my 100 Days of SwiftUI, but I also want to get my feet wet with building some projects in UIKit.
The plan is to find some time to evenly split between projects.

We'll see how it goes!

Projects in order:
* [PhotoViewer](https://github.com/ihuettel/100Days-UIKit/tree/main/PhotoViewer): A basic app for viewing photos from the National Severe Storms Laboratory
* More to come...
