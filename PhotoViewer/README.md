# PhotoViewer

This project is my 1st project in Paul Hudson's 100 Days of Swift.

Also known as Storm Viewer from the tutorials, this project introduces UIViewController, UITableViewController, as well as UIImage and UIImageView among others.

This is also technically not my first foray into Swift or UIKit, but this will hopefully help reinforce some concepts I've either learned and forgotten, learned briefly, or help me – uh, well – learn for the first time.

Off we go!
