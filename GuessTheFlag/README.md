# GuessTheFlag

This project is my 2nd project in Paul Hudson's 100 Days of Swift.

The main goal of this project is to build a simple game that asks the user to tap the correct flag for the given country. It keeps track of their score and gives feedback as to whether or not they were correct.

I've done this project once before in SwiftUI, so it's going to be an interesting mix of a refresher and learning to implement things I've done before in a slightly different way.

Exciting!
